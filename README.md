# Sage Stockmans — Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site. This project is where I experiment, learn, and showcase the things I’m building as a full stack developer in training.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- **Design:** Custom “Petrichor” theme (Playfair Display + DM Mono, earthy color palette)
- **Data:** GitHub REST API for dynamic project listing

## Features

- Clean, editorial-style layout with a focus on readability.
- Project timeline that pulls repositories directly from my GitHub profile.
- Multiple views for projects (timeline, grid, list) with sortable, enriched metadata.
- Separate pages for Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
