Perfect! I've updated the home component to cache the stats:

**What changed:**

1. **Loads from cache first** - On page load, checks localStorage for cached stats
2. **Uses cached data instantly** - If found, displays immediately without API calls
3. **Only fetches once** - If no cache, fetches projects and calculates languages, then saves to localStorage
4. **SSR safe** - Only accesses localStorage on the browser (not server-side)

**Behavior:**
- **First visit** → Fetches projects, calculates languages, saves to cache
- **Subsequent visits** → Shows cached stats instantly (no loading, no API calls)
- **Cache persists** → Across page reloads and sessions until cleared manually

The stats will remain cached until the user clears their browser storage. If your repositories change, you can manually clear the `home-stats-cache` localStorage entry to force a refresh!
