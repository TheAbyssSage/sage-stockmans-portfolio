Perfect! I've updated the code to implement progressive loading. Here's what changed:

**Before:** 
- Fetched repos → waited for all language requests → then displayed everything

**Now:**
- Fetches repos → displays projects immediately with basic data → loads language details in the background

The key changes:
1. Projects are mapped and displayed right after fetching the repo list (line 58-60)
2. `loading` is set to `false` immediately (line 66), so the UI shows the projects
3. Language requests now run in the background (line 69-77) and update individual projects as they complete

Since `mapRepoToProject` passes an empty object `{}` initially, it will use the `repo.language` field as a fallback. As each language API call completes, it updates that specific project with the full language data.

This should make the projects load instantly now!
