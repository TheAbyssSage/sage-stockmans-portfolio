    <!-- STORY -->
    <section class="about-section fade-up">
        <h2 class="about-section-title">Who I am</h2>
        <p>
            I&apos;m Sage Stockmans, a full stack developer in training with roots in
            both Belgium and the United States. I&apos;m fluent in Dutch and English,
            and I tend to stay calm and focused when things get complex or time‑sensitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            I&apos;m currently studying Full Stack Development at SyntraPXL. What draws
            me to full stack work is the creative freedom: being able to design
            a database, build an API, wire up a frontend, and end with something
            people can actually use — all in one flow.

    <!-- HOW I WORK -->
    <section class="about-section fade-up">
        <h2 class="about-section-title">How I work</h2>
        <p>
            I like clear structure, readable code, and making things robust enough
            to handle real users, not just classroom demos. I&apos;m comfortable working
            in both solo mode and in a team — splitting tasks, reviewing code, and
            adapting when priorities change.
        </p>
        <p>
            I work mainly with PHP, Laravel, MySQL, JavaScript, and Angular. I enjoy
            debugging, tracing problems through the stack, and improving reliability:
            better error handling, better data validation, and smoother user flows.
        </p>

    <!-- LEARNING & PROJECTS -->

        <h2 class="about-section-title">What I&apos;m building</h2>
        <p>
            I like learning by shipping. My projects range from simple JavaScript
            exercises like calculators and games, to full web apps that use APIs,
            authentication, and databases. Each project is an excuse to try a new
            pattern, a new tool, or a better way of structuring code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I&apos;m especially interested in building reliable backends with clean,
            well‑documented APIs, and single page frontends that feel fast and
            straightforward to use.

    <!-- HUMAN SIDE -->
    <section class="about-section fade-up">
        <h2 class="about-section-title">Outside of code</h2>
        <p>
            When I&apos;m not programming, you&apos;ll usually find me with music or games
            — anything that mixes atmosphere, good storytelling, and a bit of tension.
            I bring the same curiosity and persistence from those worlds into my work:
            explore, experiment, and keep iterating until it feels right.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you&apos;re looking for someone who enjoys problem‑solving, learns quickly,
            and is comfortable taking ownership of a piece of the stack, I&apos;d be
            happy to talk.
