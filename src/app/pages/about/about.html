            <h2 class="about-section-title">Who I am</h2>
            <p>
                I&apos;m Sage Stockmans, with roots in both Belgium and the United States.
                I&apos;m fluent in Dutch and English, and I tend to stay calm and focused
                when things get complex or time‑sensitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                I&apos;m currently studying Full Stack Development at SyntraPXL. I&apos;m drawn
                to full stack work because it gives me creative freedom: design the
                database, build the API, wire up the UI, and finish with something you
                can actually click and use.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like understanding how all the pieces fit together — from routing and
                validation on the backend, to state and UX on the frontend.

                <p>
                    I care about clear structure, predictable APIs, and frontends that feel
                    simple to use. I enjoy debugging weird bugs, improving error handling,
                    and making sure the app is reliable enough to show to real users.

                <p>
                    I&apos;m focusing on projects that combine a PHP/Laravel backend with an
                    Angular frontend: REST APIs, authentication, forms, and state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&apos;m especially interested in reliability patterns, better error messages,
                    and making it easy to understand what&apos;s going on in the system — even
                    when something goes wrong.

    <!-- HUMAN SIDE -->
    <section class="about-section fade-up">
        <h2 class="about-section-title">Outside of code</h2>
        <p>
            I&apos;m into music and games — anything with good atmosphere, tension, and
            a story. That same mix of systems and feeling is what I like in software
            too: not just code that works, but interfaces that feel considered.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you&apos;re looking for someone who enjoys problem‑solving, learns quickly,
            and likes taking ownership of a piece of the stack, I&apos;d be happy to talk.
