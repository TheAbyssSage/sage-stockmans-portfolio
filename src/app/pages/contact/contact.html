            If you&apos;re looking for someone who enjoys learning quickly, staying calm
            under pressure, and taking responsibility for a piece of the stack,
            I&apos;d be happy to hear from you.

            Email is usually the best way to reach me, but you can also connect on
            LinkedIn or explore my GitHub to see what I&apos;ve been building.

    <!-- OPTIONAL NOTE -->
    <section class="contact-note fade-up">
        <p>
            I&apos;m currently studying Full Stack Development at SyntraPXL, so I&apos;m
            especially interested in roles and projects where I can grow as a PHP /
            Laravel &amp; Angular developer, introduce new tools, and help improve
            reliability and developer experience.
